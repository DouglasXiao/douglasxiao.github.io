# Intro

I’m a Senior AI Engineer at ByteDance’s Data AI Foundation, focused on building cutting-edge multi-modal and agentic AI systems. With over a decade of experience across ByteDance, TikTok, Microsoft, Amazon, and VMware, I specialize in bridging advanced AI research with scalable engineering. My expertise spans agentic systems, reinforcement learning, prompt engineering, and large-scale platform architecture — combining strong front-end and system design skills to turn complex ideas into real-world products.

Skilled in web interface design, integrating with large-scale distributed systems, state management system like remesh and mobile React exprience like React native and Lynx.

Currently I am interested in Web, Mobile, Distributed System, AI/ML technologies, LLM, Algorithms.
